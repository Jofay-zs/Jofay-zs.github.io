## About

Hi, my name is Jofay. And this repository is my personal page, blog and portfolio.

## Technologies

For this project I use the next technologies, tools and programming languages.

- Gatsby
- Tailwind
- Strapi

## Resources

Some resources that I used to develop this project was:

- [Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs)
- [Heroku deployment for the strapi api](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/deployment/hosting-guides/heroku.html)

## Problems

At the moment that I'm writing this I have a problem with my project, practically the problem isn't mine, the problem is from a gatsby plugin that doesn't support gatsby v4. This plugin 'gatsby-source-strapi' is the plugin that allow us to connect our gatsby aplication with strapi(CMS), but for some reason that I don't understand, when you try to query images, don't even appear, so to quickly fix it I decide to wait for the new upload and meanwhile use local images
